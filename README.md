## Clojure in Nutshell

- Simple and succinct programming language designed to leverage easily
  both legacy code and modern multicore processors
  
- Dynamic typed and functional language

- Clojure simplifies multithreaded programming by using immutable data structures 
and providing powerful concurrency constructs

- Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system

- Hosted on JVM/ .NET platform

- Provides java inter-opts 

- Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection
